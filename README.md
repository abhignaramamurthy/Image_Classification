Customize a Pre-trained Model for CV Classification

Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers and systems to extract meaningful information from digital photos, videos, and other visual inputs â€” and then act or make suggestions based on that knowledge. Starting with pre-trained weights, rather than random weights, reduces training time and so is more efficient. Sampling can also increase data usability and save cycle time. Another option is feature engineering, which use machine learning techniques to turn existing data, domain knowledge, and intuition into superior, analytics-ready information. We are using a pre-trained model because, in general, the extracted characteristics for the classification job will be comparable. In the project I used the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset by O. M. Parkhi et al., 2012 which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds. Our model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories. There are 200 images for each class. The images feature a wide range of scale, pose, and illumination. Breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation are all related ground truth annotations on all images (Parkhi et al., 2012).
